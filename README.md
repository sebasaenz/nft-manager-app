# NFT Manager app
## Vue.js + Typescript Web app for creating and visualizing ERC1155 tokens
The web app is currently using an ERC1155 Open Zeppelin preset contract deployed on the GÃ¶rli network.

In order to implement NFTs over the ERC1155 specification a prefix for each type of NFT was added so they can be differentiated.
Also, tokens are being directly pulled from the TransferSingle events stored on the contract, so there's no external database storing the tokens information.
