        "q": "What are NFTs?",
        "a": "Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a special type of cryptographic token that represents something unique. In contrast with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, NFTs are not mutually interchangeable. NFTs are used in several specific applications that require unique digital items like crypto art, digital collectibles, and online gaming.<br><br>Art was an early use case for NFTs, and blockchain in general, because of its ability to provide proof of authenticity and ownership of digital art that has otherwise had to contend with the potential for mass reproduction and unauthorized distribution of art through the internet.<br><br>Later, popular blockchain games like CryptoKitties made use of NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs are used to represent in-game assets, and are controlled by the user, instead of the game developer. This lets the assets be traded on third-party marketplaces without permission from the game developer."
      },
      {
        "q": "Why would I want to get a NFT?",
        "a": "<strong>Ownership</strong><br><br>NFTs are already transforming our concept of what ownership really means. The features of blockchain technology mean that each NFT token cannot be duplicated, reproduced, or exchanged, and their ownership is immutably recorded.<br><br><strong>Transferability</strong><br><br>NFTs are instantly transferrable. There are an increasing number of secondary markets where NFTs can be bought and sold quickly and easily.<br><br><strong>Authenticity</strong><br><br>Since NFTs are based on blockchain technology, they cannot be counterfeited. This promises to overcome a long-standing problem that has plagued the art ticketing, and collectible industries. When you buy expensive physical goods, they often come with a certificate of authenticity. An NFT inherently comes with such a certificate. This gives buyers the confidence that they are getting exactly what they pay for."

      {
        "q": "What kind of information can I store in a NFT?",
        "a": "You can store any kind of information in a NFT, but the most common ones are digital art, music, certifications, licenses and any kind of information that could benefit from the security and immutability of the blockchain technology."

      {
        "q": "How can I create my own NFT?",
        "a": "Easy! Just go to our <a href='/#/app'>app</a> and create your own NFT in less than 5 minutes."
